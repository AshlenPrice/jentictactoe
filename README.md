# GA WDI Project 1 - Tic Tac Toe

## Goals

At the beginning of each cohort, update the versions in
[`package.json`](package.json) by replace all versions with a glob (`*`) and
running `npm update --save && npm update --save-dev`. You may wish to test these
changes by deleting the `node_modules` directory and running `npm install`.
Fix any conflicts.

## User Stories

A user, when viewing the game board, can click on a square, which will add their icon to the board and make it the other player’s turn (BONUS—> player 2’s icon highlighted)

A user, after completing the game, can see a display of who won the round

A user, after completing the game, can click play again, which will clear the board and change it to the other player’s turn first
